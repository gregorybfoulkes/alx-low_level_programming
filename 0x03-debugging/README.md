## Technologies

  * GNU, bash, version 5.0.17(1)
  * C files compiled using `gcc 9.4.0`

## Files

All of the following files are small programs written in C:

| ***Filename*** | ***Description*** |
|----------------|-------------------|
|[0-main.c](0-main.c)| Created a file `0-main.c` that tests if a function `positive_or_negative()` gives the correct output when given a case of `0`. |
|[1-main.c](1-main.c)| Made a copy of a main file and commented out the code that causes it to go into an infinite loop. |
|[2-largest_number.c](2-largest_number.c)| Fixed the given example code so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case. |
|[3-print_remaining_days.c](3-print_remaining_days.c)| Fixed the given function `print_remaining_days()` so that the output works correctly for all dates and all leap years. |
