## Files

All of the following are small programs written in C:

| ***Filename*** | ***Description*** |
|----------------|-------------------|
|[0-isupper.c](0-isupper.c)| A function that checks for uppercase characters. |
|[1-isdigit.c](1-isdigit.c)| A function that checks for a digit (`0` through `9`). |
|[2-mul.c](2-mul.c)| A function that multiplies two integers. |
|[3-print_numbers.c](3-print_numbers.c)| A function that prints numbers from `0` through `9`. |
|[4-print_most_numbers.c](4-print_most_numbers.c)| A function that prints numbers from `0` to `9`. |
|[5-more_numbers.c](5-more_numbers.c)| A function that prints 10 times the numbers, from `0` to `14`. |
|[6-print_line.c](6-print_line.c)| A function that draws a straight line in the terminal. |
|[7-print_diagonal.c](7-print_diagonal.c)| A function that draws a diagonal line in the terminal. |
|[8-print_square.c](8-print_square.c)| A function that prints a square. |
|[9-fizz_buzz.c](9-fizz_buzz.c)| A function that prints the numbers from `1` to `100`, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three prints `Fizz` instead of the number and for the multiples of five prints `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five prints FizzBuzz. |
